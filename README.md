# âœ¨ Class-Incremental Learning (CIL)

## What is CIL?  
**Class-Incremental Learning (CIL)** is a learning paradigm where a model **gradually learns new classes over time**.  
Unlike traditional learning, where all classes are learned at once, CIL **introduces data incrementally**,  
requiring the model to learn new classes **without forgetting previously learned ones**.  
This challenge is known as the **Catastrophic Forgetting** problem.

## Why CIL?  
Storing and training on all data at once can be **inefficient and unrealistic**.  
In cases where data is **too large** or contains **sensitive information**,  
incremental learning through CIL becomes essential.

CIL plays a crucial role in maintaining model performance in dynamic learning environments,  
allowing it to **retain past knowledge** while **adapting to new information**. ðŸš€
